My Boy (Twin Fantasy):

My boy, we don't see each other much
My boy, we don't see each other much
It'll take some time, but somewhere down the line
We won't be alone

My boy, we don't see each other much
My boy, we don't see each other much
It'll take some time, but somewhere down the line
We won't be alone

My boy, we don't see each other much
My boy, we don't see each other much
It'll take some time, but somewhere down the line
We won't be

Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba

Beach Life-In-Death:

Last- Last night I drove to Harper's Ferry and I thought about you
There were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs
The speed limit kept decreasing by ten
As we entered a town about halfway there
It was almost raining at the train station
We put our hoods on our heads at the train station
We threw rocks into the river
The river underneath the train tracks

And when the train came it was so big and powerful
When it came into the little station
I wanted to put my arms around it
But the conductor looked at me funny
So we had to say goodbye and leave
The Monopoly board still in the backseat
Took that nightmare left turn to get out of town
Ran into the decreasing speed limits again

What should I do? (Eat breakfast)
What should I do? (Eat lunch)
What should I do? (Eat dinner)
What should I do? (Go to bed)
Where can I go? (Go to the store)
Where can I go? (Apply for jobs)
Where can I go? (Go to a friend's)
Where can I go? (Go to bed)

I wrote "Beach Death" when I thought you were taken
I wrote "Beach Funeral" when I knew you were taken
I wrote "Beach Fagz"—well it wasn't about you
But it could've been- well, no, it couldn't have
I spent a week in Ocean City
And came back to find you were gone
I spent a week in Illinois
And came back to find you were still gone

I pretended I was drunk when I came out to my friends
I never came out to my friends
We were all on Skype
And I laughed and I changed the subject
She said, "what's with this dog motif?"
I said "do you have something against dogs"

I am almost completely soulless
I am incapable of being human
I am incapable of being inhuman
I am living uncontrollably

It should be called anti-depression
As a friend of mine suggested
Because it's not the sadness that hurts you
It's the brain's reaction against it

It's not enough to love the unreal
I am inseparable from the impossible
I want gravity to stop for me
My soul yearns for a fugitive from the laws of nature
I want a cut scene
I want a cut from your face to my face
I want a cut I want
The next related video

I don't want to go insane
I don't want to have schizophrenia

The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed over your grave

Part II
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you
I woke up and I was trying to kill you
It's been a year since we first met
I don't know if we're boyfriends yet

Do you have any crimes that
We can use to pass the time I am
Running out of drugs to try

We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans

Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

In the mall in the nighttime
You came back alone with a flashlight
It was the start of nothing (backwards)
And it was my favorite scene
I couldn’t tell you what it means
But it meant something to me

And pretty soon you'll find some nice young
Satanist with braces and one
Capital "O", significant Other
And you can take him home to your mother and
Say "ma, this is my brother"

We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans

Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
By the one you love
When they put their lips around you
You can feel their smile from the inside

Part III
Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you
I woke up and I was trying to kill you

Your ears perked up
I perked up when your ears perked up
You were all looking around
And I hoped it was for me
I hoped you were using your sonar systems for me

The ancients saw it coming
You can see that they tried to warn them
In the tales that they told their children
But they fell out of their heads in the morning
They said sex can be frightening
But the children were not listening
And the children cut out everything
Except for the kissing and the singing

When they finally found their home
At Walt Disney studios
And then everyone grew up
With their fundamental schemas fucked
But there are lots of fish left in the sea
There are lots of fish in business suits
That talk and walk on human feet
And visit doctors, have weak knees

Oh please let me join your cult
I'll paint my face in your colors
You have a real nice face
I had an early death

The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
(How's your face? How's your body?)
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
(We're too scared to do shit)
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
(We're too scared to do shit)

Stop Smoking (We Love You):

Stop smoking, we love you
Stop smoking, we love you
Stop smoking, we love you

Stop smoking, we love you
Stop smoking, we love you
Stop smoking, we love you
And we don't want you to die

We don't want you to die
We don't want you to die
We don't want you to die
We don't want you to die
We don't want you to die
We don't want you to die
We don't want you to die

Sober To Death:

[Verse 1]
Lovely lovely
In your jeans, frenzy
Another movie that I didn't watch with you (oh, oh, oh)
Another movie and I'm gonna have to move (no, no, no)
That final terror is in your house somewhere
Hiding in boxes, behind closed doorways
Out from the forest adjacent to your garage
I've seen its marks at the corner of your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing works
Nothing works for everyone
Good stories are bad lives
Good stories are bad lives

[Chorus]
Take your hands off your neck and hold
On to the ghost of my body
You know that good lives make bad stories
You can text me
When punching mattresses gets old
Don't think it'll always be this way
Not comforted by anything I say
We were wrecks before we crashed into each other

[Verse 2]
Such a good idea
If it turns you on
We have breakdowns (oh, oh, oh)
And sometimes we don't have breakdowns (no, no, no)
I want to hear you going psycho
If you're going psycho I wanna hear
Every conversation just ends with you screaming
Not even words, just ah-ah-ah-ah...

[Chorus]
Take my hands off your neck and hold
On to the ghost of your body
I know that good lives make bad stories
You can text me
When punching mattresses gets old
What if it'll always be this way
Not comforted by anything you say
We were wrecks before we crashed into each other

[Outro]
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more

Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more

Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more
Don't worry, you and me won't be alone no more

Nervous Young Inhumans:

[Verse 1:]
You should've seen my cursive back then
Every letter was above the line
My Ps and Qs raised their stems
So nothing crossed beneath
I'm a little better now

[Chorus:]
You never lifted your voice
You never raised your hand
You never showed me your inhuman
You understand

[Post-Chorus 1:]
Art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves

[Verse 2:]
Most people are jokes but you’re so real
Most of the time that I use the word “you”
Well you know that I’m mostly singing about you

You swore you’d never use
The face that your ex invented
So let’s meet up in
Uncanny valley

[Chorus:]
You never lifted your voice
You never raised your hand
I only show you my inhuman
You understand

[Post-Chorus 2:]
You’ll get what you want and you’ll get what you deserve
You’ll get what you want and you’ll get what you deserve


[Outro:]
I am a good person. I am a powerful person. I don't believe in evil. I think that evil is an idea created by others to avoid dealing with their own nature. I understand my own nature. Good and evil have nothing to do with it. I understand myself. I control myself. I control everything within myself. My domain is my domain. I can lie on my back and affect the lives of those I love without moving a finger. But I would only affect them in good ways. I don't waste time on evil. I'm a good person. Is this thing on?

Do you know about Jesus? Do you really know? All you know is what you've been told. Listen with your heart. Sing with your heart. You've just been singing about girls. What do you know about girls? Fuck... Why are you so tense? You've gotta start singing with love in your heart. Is this on?

Adam, are you here? A pain star has entered your house, but what are you going to do about it? Are you going to touch it? It only once happens every thousand years, maybe even two thousand years. And how long is a year, really?

It's almost Halloween. I haven't done shit this year. It's been a summer—it's been summer since February, I was in Australia. God. California? Then what? June, July, August, a month in Europe. I can't even go to Ikea anymore, I've got flashbacks. Fuck! You should see the lights that I got there, I think you'd like them
I think that- I think you'd like them a lot

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Bodys:

[Verse 1:]
That’s not what I meant to say at all
I mean, I’m sick of meaning
I just wanna hold you

But that’s not what I wanted to say at all
I mean, I’m sick of meaning
I just wanna hold you

[Break:]
Is it the chorus yet?
No. It’s just a building of the verse
So when the chorus does come, it’ll be more rewarding

[Verse 2:]
I would speak to you in song
But you can’t sing
As far as I’m aware
Though everyone can sing
As you are well aware

I keep so quiet
It’s hard to tell I’m alive

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
Everybody is swinging their hips (now)
Everybody is giving the waitress tips
Everybody’s dancing all of the dances
Everybody’s dancing every dance right now!

[Chorus 1:]
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them

[Verse 3:]
I have enough trouble controlling my own limbs
Stealing alcohol from our parents and grandparents
There’s no devil on one shoulder and angel on the other
They’re just two normal people

[Refrain:]
These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with
These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with

[Verse 4:]
But if you keep drawing my eyes on your
(These are the people that I get drunk with)
Hands and talking to the other, let's pull out
(These are the people that I fell in love with)
The nail with the back of the hammer because this
(These are the people that I get drunk with)
One has grown old and bitter -
(These are the people that I fell in love with)

[Bridge:]
Well so what?
We're young
We're thin (most of us)
We're alive (most of us)

[Chorus 2:]
Don’t you realize our bodies could fall apart at any second?
I am terrified your body could fall apart at any second

[Chorus 1:]
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them

[Verse 5:]
We can get real horny
And keep messing around
We can keep real quiet
Won’t be making no sound
I’ll try my best
Not to touch your face
Next time can we
Please meet at my place?

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
And I know that I don’t talk a lot
But I know that you don’t care a lot
As long as we move our bodies around a lot
We’ll forget that we forgot how to talk

[Chorus 3:]
When we dance, when we
When we dance, when we

[Chorus 4:]
Don’t you realize our bodies could fall apart at any second?
I am terrified your body could fall apart at any second
(Those are you got some nice shoulders)
(I'd like to put my hands around them)
(I'd like to put my hands around them)
When we dance
(That’s not what I meant to say at all)
When we dance
(I mean, I’m sick of meaning, I just want hold you)
When we dance
(But that’s not what I wanted to say at all)
When we dance
(I mean, I’m sick of meaning, I just want hold you)

[Outro:]
I'm on a need to know to basis
(I'm on a need-)
I'm on a need to know to basis
I'm on a need to know to basis
(Need to know?)
I'm on a need to know to basis
No one tells me shit
Unless I need to hear it
I'm on a need to know to basis
I'm on a need to know to basis
Yeah
No one tells me shit
Unless I need to hear it

Cute Thing:

[Verse 1]
I got so fucking romantic
I apologize
Lemme light your cigarette
Come visit Kansas for a week of debauchery
Songs and high fives and weird sex

[Chorus]
Cute thing
Don't be a rude thing
Hot thing
It was nothing

[Post-Chorus 1]
God
Give me Frank Ocean's voice
And James Brown's stage presence
I will be your rock, God, when you're rolling the dice

[Verse 2]
I got so fucking romantic
I apologize
Lemme smoke your weed, no wait
Healthy minds make sexy bodies
Let us touch so much of ourselves together

[Chorus]
Cute thing (cute thing, cute thing)
Don't be a rude thing (don't be rude, don't be a rude thing)
Hot thing (hot thing, hot thing)
It was nothing (it was nothing, it was nothing)

[Post-Chorus 2]
Dog (ooh ooh)
Give me one little chance (ooh ooh)
I can make you a man (ooh ooh)
I will be your rock, dog, (woof woof) when you're rolling your eyes
(Ooooh ooooh ooooh)
(Ooooh ooooh ooooh)
(Ooooh ooooh ooooh)

[Guitar breakdown]
(Do do do, do do do, do do)
(Do do do, do do do, do do)
(Do do do, do do do, do do)
(Do do do, do do do, do do)

[Bridge]
He died in an explosion
Of mixed media and poorly written reviews
And some stammering drunk who tried to tell him how good his shit was
"That's- that's, ah- that's- that's some good- good shit, man"
I accidentally spoke his first name aloud
Trying to make it fit in the lyrics of "Ana Ng"
Worked like a charm

We're getting old
When will we walk in each other's majestic presence?
Listen, hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say if I was John Linnell
Or trying to be John Linnell

[Outro]
I am love
I am love
I would sleep naked
Next to you naked
I am love
I am love
I would sleep naked
Next to you naked
I am love
I am love
Like some excommunicated priest
Casting demons
Asked one what its name was

----------------------------------------------------------

High To Death:

I fell over
I fell onto the ground
I wish I was sober
I can't get up off the ground

When I closed my eyes
And I thought I was blind
It's the middle of the night
And I'll never be alright again

And this wallpaper
Keeps going round the room
It keeps going round the room
It keeps going round the room
And I follow it around the room
And I follow it around the room

Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I still love you

But I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

(William! Let me out!
William!
William! Let me out, William!)

And I sat there on the steps
Considering death
There were only seconds left
Of the night

And I said hell is the sun
Burning forever at the centre of things
A ball on fire at the centre of things
A ball on fire at the centre of things
A brain on fire at the centre of things
A brain on fire at the centre of things...

I can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
Used to be so human now it’s just a machine
I can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
When’d you say you were leaving?
When’d you really leave?

I can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
Used to be so human now it’s just a machine
I can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
When’d you say you were leaving?
When’d you really leave?

[Outro:]
(Welcome to the Nevada Museum of Art audio guide. We hope your experience will be-)

Hello, my name is Hojin Stella Jung, I'm a senior at McQueen High School, my portfolio is a collection of paintings - that was created during last summer, and the first half of my senior year, and it's called "The Lady", and I didn't feel very well when I painted the first, and I didn't feel very well when I painted the last. It was intense, it was an intense process, and it was how I was trying to - very hard, personify that intensity, but it's hard to talk about her now, because I think she wasn't me, at least that's how I feel and I'm trying to figure out what to do now

But she represents fervor in woman, she is powerful, yet fragile, she dares but also averts her gaze, and I love her, at least - I did, and - but now I feel lost, and I'm unsure of what to think and feel most of the time
But I did believe in her, "The Lady", and maybe, there is a different form now that the intensity takes

Famous Prophets (Stars):

Apologies to future mes and yous
But I can't help feeling like we're through
The ripping of the tape hurts my ears
In my years, I have never seen anyone quit quite like you do

Twin bruises on my shins
From where I kicked the back of the seat in
They meant what I went through for you
But now they're fading, now they're gone

(Don't spend too much time on it)

These teenage hands will never touch yours again
But I remember you
You had a body
You had hands and arms and legs and et cetera

Did I fail? Did I fall?
(In the morning when I wake up, are you mine?)
Did I waste my time, waste my time on a broken heart?
(Take the trash out like a bad dream, are you gone?)
Or is this the start of the great silence?
(From the old house, the fiercest heart spoke, are you mine?)
Is this the start of every day?
(Christmas tree's dead, you know how time flies, are you gone?)

I'm not gonna end up a nervous wreck
Like the people I know who are nervous wrecks
Though I'm not gonna name names
(Yours was an exception)
Did the sound just stop?
At the end of every day
There'll be nothing left to say
There'll be no backstage pass

We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back

We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)

We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back

Don't get too impressed
You might lose your breath
Don't predict your death
'Cause I like you the best

Don't you fall apart
You might lose my heart
You know I love your art

The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave

So descend into cliche
If you've found your holy grail
I could fill back in that grave
I could hammer in that nail
I could give you what you want
I could give you what you deserve
I could sing another song
I could watch that hammer swerve

And when the mirror breaks
I wouldn't miss it for the world
Call it blackstar, call it painstar
The same thing happens when you touch it
Did they tell you, did they tell you what happens when you touch it? Did they tell you?
Let me tell you what happens when you touch it, let me, let me, let me, let-

Let me
Let me in

So descend into cliché
If the music has forsaken you
Roll the stone over the grave
I never liked that one anyways
Or stare into the face
Of whatever it is that's facing you
And if the levee breaks
You'll find out what it is that's replacing you

And when the mirror breaks
I wouldn't miss it for the world
Call it blackstar, call it painstar
The same thing happens when you touch it
Did they tell you what happens when you touch it?
Did they tell you what happens when you touch it?
Did they tell you...
Did they tell me...

What happened to you?

[Spoken:]
Love-
I gain nothing - I have love, I gain nothing - I have love...
If I give all I possess to the poor (all I possess to the poor) and give over my body to hardship (over my body to hardship) that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing - I gain nothing
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast-
Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres-

(My
Be
It'll take some time
It'll-It'll
Be
Won't
We won't
Each
My
Don't see
Don't see
Don't
We won't see
We won't see
We won't
Be
Don't

Somewhere-where down the
Down the
Down the
Down the line
Down the line
Down the line
Down
Down
M-m-my
M-m-m-my
It'll take some time
It'll
But somewhere
Down the line
We won't be)

[Spoken:]
Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. At the end of my childhood, I put these ways behind me. For now, we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known

And now these two remain

Twin Fantasy (Those Boys):

I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurts to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurts to

The show ain’t over
They’ll keep on going
They’ll keep on laughing
And fucking around, round, round, round, round

Off into the distance
Those two brothers
Those two lovers
And their smooth-cocked adventures, tures, tures, tures

I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurts to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurts to

I haven't been outside, I haven't been outside
I haven't been outside, I haven't been outside

They just want to be one
Walk off into the sun
They’re not kissing
They’re not fucking
They’re just having fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

(I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurts to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurts to)

They were connected
At the back of the head
They had a conduit
Their minds were the same

They were connected
(We were connected)
At the back of the head
(At the back of the head)
They had a conduit
(We had a conduit)
Their minds were the same
(Their minds were the same)

(I haven't been outside, I haven't been outside
I haven't been outside, I haven't been outside)

This ain’t the end
We’ll see them again

[Spoken:]
This is the end of the song, and it is just a song. This is a version of me and you that can exist outside of everything else, and if it is just a fantasy, then anything can happen from here. The contract is up. The names have been changed. So pour one out, whoever you are. These are only lyrics now

When I come back you'll still be here
When I come back you'll still be here

When I come back you'll still be here
(When you come back I'll still be here)
When I come back you'll still be here
(When you come back I'll still be here)

When I come back you'll still be here
(When you come back I'll still be here)
When I come back you'll still be here
(When you come back I'll still be here)

When I come back you'll still be here
(When I come back you'll still be here)
When I come back you'll still be here
(When I come back you'll still be here)
